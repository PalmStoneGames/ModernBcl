This package is a downport of the .NET 4.5 runtime of mono, which is MIT licensed, to run with .NET 3.5 runtime.
This allows environments which are stuck with an old version of Microsoft .NET or Mono to use features such as async/await as well as most of what the 4.5 .NET framework has to offer

As almost all of the code in this package was taken from the Mono project, which gracefully released all of it under an MIT license, we've licensed this downport under the MIT license as well, enjoy!

Note: I've only downported the parts I'm personally interested in, however, pull requests downporting additional parts (including passing tests) are welcome and will be merged.
